/**
Bill Clinton Boulevard is a boulevard located in Pristina, the capital and largest city of Kosovo.[a] After the Kosovo War of 1998-1999, the Albanians in Kosovo wanted to thank the American President Bill Clinton for his help in their struggle with the government of the FR Yugoslavia. A 10-foot-high (3.0 m) statue of Clinton was unveiled on the boulevard on November 1, 2009, in a ceremony at which the former president spoke.[1]

Elsewhere in Pristina, Kosovo has named a central street after American President George W. Bush.[1] There are also several cities in Kosovo, including Prizren, with streets named after American President Woodrow Wilson.
